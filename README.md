# Career-ChatBot
A chatbot that was created to give computer science majors a short quiz to see what kind of career would be suited for them.


## Purpose of this project
The purpose of creating this chatbot is help student traffic between computer science majors and career advisors at Universities. The students will be communicating with a bot, and the bot will ask them a few questions to get a better understanding of the human that they are talking to. When the student finishes the short career quiz, the bot will give the student a career choice, based on the replies from the student. The bot uses AIML and utilizes <think> and <set> tags to store the student’s response under q1,q2,q3,q4 and q5. When the student answers all the questions, the bot will analyze the students answers and reply with career options that are tailored to each student.
